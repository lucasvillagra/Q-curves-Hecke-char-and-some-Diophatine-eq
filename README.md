# Code for the article: Q-curves, Hecke characters and some Diophatine equations.

This git repository contains files related to the computational part of the article: Q-curves, Hecke characters and some Diophatine equations. It contains the codes used to run "Mazur's trick" (Proposition 6.1), ir order to discard the newforms and also the code to compute Ellenberg's bounds (Theorem 5.2).
